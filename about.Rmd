## Myself

I'm an engineer working on the effects of various stress factors (chemicals, temperature, *etc.*) on aquatic animals. Indeed, in a world where industrial sectors dominate, studying their effects on biota and the diversity that makes it up seems essential to me. I believe that our children have the right to discover what we have discovered with our own eyes, as long as it respects the concept described by Elton John: "It's the circle of life".

I am also a big fan of coding, particularly with [RStudio](https://posit.co/). Yes, I know it's strange... But I'm also a big sports fan: cycling, athletics, basketball, *etc.*

## Sport

I have been practicing cycling at a high level since my childhood ([Direct Vélo](https://www.directvelo.com/coureur/18262/benjamin-bellier)), and I even won with my team ([Vélo Club Lucéen](https://www.velo-club-luce-28.com/)) the French National 3 Cup in 2021. Otherwise, I am extremely knowledgeable about the subject and Interesting fact: I am one of the few people who can keep from falling asleep during an entire stage of the Tour de France.

Now, I've stopped cycling... But to discover triathlon, just to suffer a little more. I recently completed the Luchon half iron man (certificate below). Yes, it's true, I didn't go very fast...

## Costa Rica

I had the opportunity to live in Costa Rica for \~1 year. I was able to discover many of nature's wonders, especially on my first month's backpacking trip. The fruit there is so good! As always, I totally enjoyed man's best friend (see proof below). The country's atmosphere is truly atypical and many places are so unique.
